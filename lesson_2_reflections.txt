When you initialize a repository, git creates a new repository
for the current working directory and all files contained within.
You need to do this in order to begin using commits to control
versions of your code.

The staging area is different from the working directory and 
repository beacuse it is simply an abstract area in git in 
which to add files you wish to be part of a commit.  I think
it offers a user the ability to pick and choose which files
will be part of a commit without having to modify or move files
within a working directory or within a repository.
