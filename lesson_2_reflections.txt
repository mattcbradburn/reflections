When you initialize a repository, git creates a new repository
for the current working directory and all files contained within.
You need to do this in order to begin using commits to control
versions of your code.

The staging area is different from the working directory and 
repository beacuse it is simply an abstract area in git in 
which to add files you wish to be part of a commit.  I think
it offers a user the ability to pick and choose which files
will be part of a commit without having to modify or move files
within a working directory or within a repository. 

You can use the staging area to ensure you have only one logical
change per commit by adding files to the staging area and then
using diff to compare changes made against the most recent commit.

Branches would be useful in situations where you would add an 
experimental feature or different version of a program.

Automatic merging allows easy merges to be done without taking
the time to do it yourself.  In the even where an auto merge fails
it is nice to have the option to manually merge the files.
