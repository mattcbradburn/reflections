When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when I may be working on a project with different computers or
  if I was working with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Somebody may make a change that will break your code.  You do not want to be automatically updating you local copy with 
  possibly invalid code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are used to clone a repository from one GitHub user to another.  Clone allows a repository to be copied either from
  remote to local, or local to local.  Lastly, a branch is just a different version of code within one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  Allows a user to know if their local repo is ahead of the last known state of the remote repo.  Additionally it 
  allows a user to know if the remote repo has changed since the last pull or clone.
