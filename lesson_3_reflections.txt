When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when I may be working on a project with different computers or
  if I was working with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Somebody may make a change that will break your code.  You do not want to be automatically updating you local copy with 
  possibly invalid code.
