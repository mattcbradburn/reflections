Using diff to view differences between two files was helpful
in allowing the computer to quickly highlight differences between
the files.  This was even more useful on the very long javascript
files that made up the asteroid game.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file would make me
a more efficient programmer because it would allow me to quickly
and easily go back to previous known working versions of code if 
something went wrong when making changes.

When you manually choose when to commit changes to code, it allows
you to save changes at sensible points in time.  If code was to 
save automatically, there would be times when it is saved with errors
or half-written lines of code.

Some version control systems allow saving multiples files in one commit
because it is often the case that changing some thing about code requires
edits to be made accross multiple files.

You can use git log to view the history of commits, then use git 
diff to compare the differences of different commits.

Having version control allows you to easily move back to previous 
working versions of code, thus allowing you to make changes worry
free since any error can be undone.

I want to use git for tracking versions of all my projects!
